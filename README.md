# BikeSharingAssignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
>  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
>  - How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
> According to the model built, there are four main features contributing to the demand of the model. Namely atemp,yr, season - winter and season - summer.
> All the above mentioned are postively correlated. 
> The above mentioned features are correlated and have a coefficent values as follows:
>  - atemp with a coefficient of 0.462
>  - yr with a coefficient of 0.235
>  - season winter with a coefficient of 0.057
>  - season summer with a coefficient of 0.023
